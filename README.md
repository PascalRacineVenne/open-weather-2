## Reflection

- The purpose of this project was to implement API calls and display the results in a fully responsive environment.
- My intend was to build a simple weather app that I would design and programmed.
- The challenging part of it was diving deeper into SASS to make it fully responsive, tackling many media queries.
- Obstacle wise, It was more challenging then expected to style properly the REACT-SELECT drop-down, but I made it ;-)
- I used create-react-app as a starting point for the app and use Node.js && ExpresJs to manage the back-end.
  + Used Rapid API GeoDBCities to fetch cities latitude and longitude
  + Used Openweather API to fetch current weather and forecast for givin city.
- SASS integration I getting better and better, I will refactor it to take advantage of all of SASS superpowers.
